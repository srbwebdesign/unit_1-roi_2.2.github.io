      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Red Opal Innovations believes that the provision of a safe working environment for everyone at our workplaces is an essential part of the effective operation of our organisation.  We are committed to complying with WHS legislation, Work Health and Safety Act 2011 No 10 and therefore, ensuring the wellbeing of our workplace and the safety of our workers by upholding these standards.</p>
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>ROI operates in accordance with the NSW Work Health and Safety Act 2011 No 10 and as so these are our goals.</p>
      <table><tr><th>Company Goals</th></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>1.</strong>To provide a clear guideline for each employee, in the form of a job description, outlining relevant responsibilities. This will establish a list of duties that can matched with employee skill set, to ensure they can be performed at the highest level, and within management’s expectations.  This will also provide a means of measurement for performance appraisals, ongoing educational recommendations etc.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>2.</strong>By becoming a corporate member of National Safety Council of Australia, our employees have access to National Safety Magazines (6 issues per/yr), Safe-T Bulletin fortnightly email updates, expert legal advice 24/7, access to essential resources and industry update, events and networking events and exclusive webinars on latest WHS topics.  We will also enjoy up to 15% discount on training and Green cap consulting.  It is our intention to build a WHS Management System to eventually be located on the company intranet that is specific to ROI.  As we rapidly expand we are committed to implementing and improving our overall safety performance, WHS policies, procedures, forms and checklists. It is our intention to provide training and information to enable employees to carry out their work safely and efficiently. <italic> (Div 4 Duty of officers, workers and other persons). </italic></td></tr>
      <tr></td><td><strong>3.</strong>It is our goal to continue to hold WHS Committee Meetings regularly (every quarter and any reasonable time upon the request of at least half of the members). (Div 4 Duty of officers, workers and other persons ). The Managers for each of the six departments; Development, Multimedia Productions, Sales and Marketing, Human Resources, IT Support and Accounts will adopt the role of WHS Officers initially. It will be their responsibility to assess the risk or hazard, ways of eliminating or minimising and then assessing if the cost is appropriate or disproportionate to the hazard or likelihood and the degree of harm the risk or hazard would inflict.<italic>(Subdivision 2 What is reasonably practicable)</italic></td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>4.</strong>After the initial setting-up period, it will be the Managers responsibility to hold an anonymous vote to nominate a department WHS Officer who will become a permit holder.  By providing a WHS Officer who is not the Manager will add and opportunity to take on more responsibility and build skills.  It will also offer a non-partisan approach by taking the Manager out of the equation. <italic>( Subdivision 4 Election of health and safety representatives)</italic></td></tr>
